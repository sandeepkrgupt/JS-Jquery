Everything in Javascript is an Object.
Object - Every component in Javascript is an Object including Function, Array, String and Number.

Creating Object -
i) Object literal 
var obj = {name : "san", class : 3}
ii) constructor -
function xyz(){

}
var obj = new xyz(arg1,arg2,...);
iii) Prototype -
function xyz(){}
xyz.prototype.name = "san";
xyz.prototype.class = 3;
xyz.prototype.dtl = function(){
console.log(this.name + " " + this.class);
};

Encapsulation = Hiding background details and showing the functionality is called Encapsulation.

Inheritance - Inheriting or aquring all the properties of parent class to child class is called Inheritance.
Javascript supports only Single Inheritance.

Constructor - 
Constructor is special method which creates object of the existing class using new kewword.
Note : -
1. Constructors have no return type.
2. Constructors function name is same as that of class name.

The important difference between constructors and methods -
1. constructors create and initialize objects that don't exist yet, 
   while methods perform operations on objects that already exist.

2. Constructors can't be called directly; they are called implicitly when the new keyword creates an object. 
   Methods can be called directly on an object that has already been created with new.
   <script>
   class myClass1{
   ---------------
   }
   var classobj = new myClass1(); // constructor 
   </script>
