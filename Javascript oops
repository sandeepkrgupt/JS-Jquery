Constructor - 
Constructor is special method which creates object of the existing class using new kewword.
Note : -
1. Constructors have no return type.
2. Constructors function name is same as that of class name.

The important difference between constructors and methods -
1. constructors create and initialize objects that don't exist yet, 
   while methods perform operations on objects that already exist.

2. Constructors can't be called directly; they are called implicitly when the new keyword creates an object. 
   Methods can be called directly on an object that has already been created with new.
