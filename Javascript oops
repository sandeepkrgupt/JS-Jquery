Javascript Class -
JavaScript is a prototype-based language and contains no class statement, such as is found in C++ or Java.
In the example below we define a new class called Person with an empty constructor.
var Person = function () {};
--------------------------------------------------
Javascript Object/ Instance
In the example below we create one instances
var person1 = new Person();
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The constructor

The constructor is called at the moment of instantiation (the moment when the object instance is created). 
The constructor is a method of the class.
